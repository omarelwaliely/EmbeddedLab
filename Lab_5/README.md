Interfacing with I2C and SPI Peripherals

Experiment 4 (in Lab): Create a program to interface with a 
MCP3202 12 bit A/D converter using SPI. Connect a potentiometer and print the the digital values in hexadecimal.

Experiment 1: Create a program that interfaces the microcontroller with a DS3231 using I2C. Use UART1 and send to print the time and temperature.

Experiment 2: Allow a user to enter an alarm into the DS3231 and use a buzzer to sound the alarm. Adding another alarm will turn off the buzzer and not activate it until the next alarm.
